# feedbackcollector
PHP application designed to collect team feedback and enable insight into that data

I started this in Spring2016 as a final project for HSE's Intro to Web Development. It was my both my first attempt at web application as well as my frst PHP application. I was originally inspired by:
* [NYTimes's coverage of Google's "perfect" teams research](https://www.nytimes.com/2016/02/28/magazine/what-google-learned-from-its-quest-to-build-the-perfect-team.html?mcubz=0) 
* [Wired's take on Facebook's reaction button](https://www.wired.com/2016/02/facebook-reactions-totally-redesigned-like-button/)

I'm resurrecting it because I still am interested the idea that regular, anonymous feedback can have a positive impact on team dynamic and performance. Currently not production ready or deployed. I'll keep cleaning up and get it Live soon.
